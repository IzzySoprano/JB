                <h3>About</h3>
                <p> Jon Jones is widely considered one of the greatest mixed martial artists of all time who has
                    dominated the UFC over the last decade. Famous as an unorthodox fighter not afraid to use
                    the/.mn
                    divisive “oblique kick”, Jones was #1 in the UFC men’s pound-for-pound rankings in 2019, and
                    holds the records as the youngest champion in UFC history after his victory over Maurício
                    Rua
                    when he was 23 years old. His other record-breaking achievements include the most
                    consecutive
                    title defences and the longest winning streak. Inducted into the prestigious Sherdog’s MMA
                    Hall
                    of Fame, he is also the first MMA fighter to represent Nike – who offered him the chance to
                    develop his own line of shoes – and Gatorade.
                    <br>
                    Born in Rochester, New York, Jones stood out as a wrestler at high school, also playing
                    football. After dropping out of college to kick-start his MMA career, he made his MMA debut
                    in
                    spring 2008. After three years of consecutive wins, Jones made his mark when he became the
                    youngest UFC Champion in history at the age of 23. Jones has been involved in controversies
                    outside of the ring, but has proved time and time again that he will always come back
                    stronger.
                    After his 2017 suspension was lifted, he quickly defeated Alexander Gustafsson to reclaim
                    the
                    UFC Light Heavyweight Championship.
                    <br>
                    In 2020 Jones stated he was planning to move up to heavyweight on social media. Whatever the
                    legendary fighter does next, he has already cemented his place among the all-time greats.

                <p>ESPN MMA’s Ariel Helwani sits down with Jon Jones at the Jackson Wink MMA Academy in
                    Albuquerque, New Mexico to preview his light heavyweight title fight vs. Dominick
                    Reyes at
                    UFC 247 and more, including: (3:01​) improving his life because he felt he was
                    throwing his
                    greatness away, (7:31​) overcoming the loss of his mother, (19:38​) potentially
