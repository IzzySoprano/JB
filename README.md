### Testing

### Challenges

- Wasn't familiar with Git, source control and how to commit at first, but after reaching out to the Slack community, I've come to understand it and how it works.
- Had trouble understanding how to section content using the Bootstrap Grid System, CSS Flexbox. 
- After my first initial deployment, the site link wasn't working responsibly. 
- Sectioning my footer into 3 sections at the start was difficult as I couldn't understand CSS/BS Grid.
Understanding Flexbox, Bootstrap Grid
- The table on index page wasn't resposnive due to padding
- The social icons weren't not appearing as I had a div that wasn't needed

#Bugs

- Mainly issues with understanding content
