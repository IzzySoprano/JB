### Testing

- Had trouble understanding how to section content using the Bootstrap Grid System, CSS Flexbox. 
- After my first initial deployment, the links were'nt working responsibly. 
- Understanding Flexbox, Bootstrap Grid
- The table on index page wasn't resposnive due to padding
- The social icons weren't not appearing as I had a div that wasn't needed
